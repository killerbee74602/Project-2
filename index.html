        <h2>What is Water Conservation</h2>
        <p>The practice of efficiently preserving, controlling, and managing water resources
            Water conservation is essential to every part of the world, even where water seems to be enough.
            It’s the more practical environment-friendly approach to lessen the need for water. Using less water puts less weight on the sewage treatment facilities, 
            which use ample energy to heat water.
